Context: Theories About the Creation of the Universe
1. Big Bang Theory
The Big Bang theory suggests that the universe began as a single, extremely hot and dense point about 13.8 billion years ago. It rapidly expanded, and over time, matter cooled to form stars, galaxies, and everything we observe today.

2. Simulation Hypothesis
The Simulation Hypothesis proposes that our universe might be an artificial simulation, like a computer program, created by a highly advanced civilization. According to this idea, everything—including space, time, and matter—could be digitally generated.

3. Steady State Theory
The Steady State theory claims that the universe has always existed in a constant state and will continue to do so. It continuously creates new matter as it expands, so its overall appearance does not change over time.

4. Creationism
Creationism is the belief that the universe and life were created by a divine being or higher power according to a specific purpose or plan. This theory is often rooted in religious traditions.
